# RISC-processor
A soft RISC processor on Xilinx FPGA with Verilog and an assembler with Python

It is my undergrad graduation project in Istanbul Technical University.

Processor is designed on Xilinx ISE 13.2 with Verilog. Also processor simulated in [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) simulation program.

Assembler for new instrction set is developed with Python 2.

Detailed information, usage and examples can be found in project report.

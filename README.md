# RISC processor
A soft RISC processor on Xilinx FPGA with Verilog and an assembler with Python. It is my undergrad graduation project in Istanbul Technical University.

Processor is designed on Xilinx ISE 13.2 with Verilog. Processor tested on Xilinx ATLYS board. 

Also processor simulated in [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) logic simulation program. Logisim simulation circuits are in [logisim_processor](logisim_processor) folder.

Assembler for new instruction set is developed with Python 2. Python assembler is in [python_assembler](python_assembler) folder.

Detailed information, usage and examples about project can be found in [Project report](report.pdf).
